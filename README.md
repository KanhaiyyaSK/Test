## Future Improvements

As we continue to develop and improve AniMates, here are some features and improvements we plan to add in the future:
- Store and analyze lab vitals in charts for easy insights 
- Push notifications for mobile and browser to remind users of appointments, medicine refills, and other important events.
- Port the application to a mobile app for more seamless integration with users' daily routines.
- Develop a business model that includes a Pro version with advanced features, as well as partnerships with healthcare providers and insurance companies.
